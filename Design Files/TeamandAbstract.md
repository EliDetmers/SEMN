### Abstract
By using AI image generation, users will be able to create custom pictures based on prompts they give as input to the application. Custom pictures will be uploaded to our application and the user will apply tags to the image. Our AI data model will be able to read the images/tags and use them to generate images. For example, if a user uploads a picture of their friend, (we'll call the friend Eli), then the user could tell the AI to generate an image of Eli jumping a motorcycle over a volcano, and the AI will create that image for them to use however they prefer. After the images are generated, they can be exported to the user's device and used at their discretion.
