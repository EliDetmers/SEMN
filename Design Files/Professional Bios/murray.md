**Project Sought**

I want to work on a web application that will be helpful to people in some way, shape, or form. I have a few ideas that could be interesting to try out, but my main goal is to work on something that could have a real-life use case. I would also prefer to 
work mainly on frontend as that is my main area of expertise.
