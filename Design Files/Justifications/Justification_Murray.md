# Summary of Hours and Justification
## Nick Murray
In about 48 hours, I created the front-end of the Dreamscape application. I created the application in React.js using the React framework alongside Javascript, HTML,
and css. Another 5-10 hours were used to connect the AI model API calls to the front-end that I created. Then there was another 10 hours working on semester assignments
and getting things set up for the expo.
