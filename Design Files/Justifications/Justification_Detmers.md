 ## Explanation
 I spent at least an hour per week achomplishing design diagram and planning assignments, mostly in the Fall semester (approximately 13 meetings). The inital project 
 decision and research took 7 hours. I assisted with UI design for several meetings. The organization of the poster, powerpoint, video, and results verification made up
 the expo hours. Fixing the results of the API during presentation week took 6.5 hours, and I assisted with the debugging and set up of the project on the necessary machines.
