 ## Explanation
 I spent most of my time in fall meeting with the group and researching in order to be prepared for implementing things in the spring. I studied previous expo posters and created the initial designs for our poster in order for us to outline what would be most effective for us. I spent time preparing equipment for the expo and giving our presentation. The test plan took up a lot of time as I made it more detailed and specific to what we wanted to implement. The group worked together on multiple occasions to make sure we could get things working and just get everyone on the same page.
