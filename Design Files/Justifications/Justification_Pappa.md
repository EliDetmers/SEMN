# Summary of Hours and Justification
## Michael Pappa
Over 45 hours, I played a key role in developing the API its connection to the Replicate AI model hosting service. 
About 5 hours were dedicated to finding the best AI model to use for our project with tests of each. 15 hours went into coding and testing the API endpoints and authentication mechanisms. 
I spent another 5 hours in the setup and optimization of the Lora AI model on Replicat, while another 5 hours went into the setup of the GCS cloud storage.
The remaining 10 hours focused on the expo and other canvas senior design tasks throughout the semester.
