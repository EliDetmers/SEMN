# Final Individual Assessment
## Nick Murray

The individual contributions that I made to this assignment were to design the front-end of the application, and then once the AI model was trained, to connect the API 
calls to the front-end that I had created. I applied the skills that I brought to our team as I was named the team member that would create and build the front-end of
the app. This decision was made because I have over a year of experience in my COOPs working with React on different front-end projects. 
	
For our project Dreamscape, I created a front-end using React.js. I did this in about two weeks very early on in the semester and then made changes throughout when the
group wanted me to. Once my team member finished training the AI model, I was able to connect the calls to the application through onClick events and the app was then 
functional. What I learned from this project was how to successfully create and demonstrate an application. I have previously worked on teams where I have created 
applications, but I have never had the ability to be creative and make an application with this much elbow room. Another thing that I learned was how to connect API 
calls to a web application. I have done this before, but I did not have a great understanding of what I was doing, and now I feel that I have become more competent in 
this ability. The successes that I had were making this application and getting everything working before our demo. An obstacle I had was getting the APIs connected 
and working because we were having a lot of fetch errors for a while.

Our group accomplished a major goal: successfully creating and demonstrating the value of our application. What I learned about group work is that it is very 
important in a project like this to make a timeline of when you want to hit teammate checkpoints. If one person is behind on their part, you need to shift focus to 
help them in order to keep the whole team moving forward. The aspects of teamwork that were successful were the communication and execution. Our team talked all the 
time to make sure that we were making progress and communicated any issues that anyone was having so that someone could help them out. We also executed the creation 
of this application swiftly and efficiently, which helped all of us to not be too stressed as the expo date came closer. An aspect of teamwork that was less 
successful was the mid-term dates that we set to have the application running and ready for testing. We had one team member fall a little behind while the rest of us 
were busy with other classes/work and we did not end up getting the entire application running until a few weeks later. This did not turn out to be too much of a 
problem because we were already ahead of schedule.

I think that I contributed just as much effort to this project if not more than my team members. As I said before, I created the front-end of the application, and 
another team member worked on training the AI model, so we both put in a lot of effort in teamwork as well as individually to get the application executing in time 
for the expo. I think that all of my team members deserve special recognition because throughout the entire project, we all played a big part in making something 
that could be used in the world today. From the original idea of the application to the execution and demonstration of it, each team member worked very hard to 
make an application that was important to us.
