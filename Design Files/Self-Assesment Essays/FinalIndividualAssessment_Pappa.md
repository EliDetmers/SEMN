# Final Individual Assessment
## Michael Pappa

As a member of the Dreamscape team responsible my primary focus was on developing the API and the setup and connection of the AI model through the Replicate hosting service. 
Leveraging my skills in software engineering and machine learning, 
I spearheaded the design and implementation of the API endpoints for image hosting, model training, and image generation. 
Additionally, I was responsible for implementing bucket cloud storage utilizing Google Cloud services and I conducted thorough testing of the API endpoints using unit tests  to validate functionality. 

Throughout the project, I applied and built upon the skills identified in my initial assessment from last fall, including proficiency in Python programming, 
knowledge of deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, and experience in developing APIs. Through working on this project, I enhanced my abilities in project management, communication, and teamwork. 
Despite encountering obstacles such as switching hosting services late in development due to deprecation and badly generated images due to faulty training images, 
our team successfully delivered a robust and user-friendly application. 
This experience not only reinforced my technical competencies but also helped to improve my abilities for real-world software development projects.
