# Final Individual Assessment
## Eli Detmers

  My individual contribution was originally intended to be mostly with the database side. We intended to have a user sign in system to save the data for users 
so they could load into trained situations.  We ended up having more trouble then we thought getting the API and the front-end working, so I shifted to debugging 
multiple sides before the expo. The skills applied and built on were Github, Python, and front-end development. While I have used Github before, I had never created
a repo from scratch and made decisions on placement and creation of files. My python skills before were tailored to specific problems, and had nothing to do with API
work, and my front-end skills were very basic, and needed a lot of work to accomplish what was needed.
  I was involved in the designing and debugging of the front-end. This was accomplished by working with Nick Murray’s developing skills. I tracked down and researched
bugs, while learning many front-end tools and practices from Nick’s experience. I also debugged the connection of the API to the front-end. Michael Pappa was the lead 
on this, but designing and testing required us all to be connected. This took a lot of research into API specific issues. The UI was successful, and the connection
stable, but the obstacles included appropriate permissions for users, and my front-end development skills being very basic. I also had the obstacle of limited 
experience with APIs.
  Our group was able to produce a great UI and some very satisfying and useful outputs. The screen shots we were able to display on our poster are exactly what we had 
in mind for the use of our application. I learned about the importance of consistent involvement in groupwork. We were successful in dividing roles for our individual 
strengths and agreeing on things. There were very few disagreements in our group, and we demonstrated a vast collective knowledge at the expo. I personally was
unsuccessful in being consistent with my involvement. It was difficult to catch-up and return to previous levels of involvement after a few weeks off. We were very 
consistent in our meetings in the fall semester, but as we split into our individual tasks we struggled to maintain communication. 
	We were also perhaps to separate in our work. It made it difficult to fix errors. For example, fixing API connection bugs was difficult as only one of us was as
familiar as necessary to understand the messages, making debugging very slow. While my effort in the planning phase was more than satisfactory, I struggled to 
contribute as effectively as my teammates in spearheading specific tasks. I believe I did contribute in meaningful ways, but my overall contribution was slightly 
less than that of my teammates. Michael Pappa’s work on the API deserves recognition. His understanding and debugging was crucial to the project.
